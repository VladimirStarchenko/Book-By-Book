# Book By Book

Books are amazing. A gateway to another world, access to new information. Books are an amazing way to destress and take the edge off of work and life. But sometimes, even for the most avid readers a book is hard to choose. Why should you spend ages browsing the internet when you can easily solve your problems with the book by book app. It's simple and effective. 

Whenever you feel hungry for literature finding a book is as simple as loggin in. Or for new users signing up. You really only need a unique username, an email and a password and let the searching begin. From here on in you can find any book, maybe based off a name you heard or a movie you watched. And save that book for later. Enjoy.
